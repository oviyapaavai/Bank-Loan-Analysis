# Introduction 
Bank loans are an essential resource for both individuals and businesses, offering the needed capital for a range of objectives, from personal projects to business growth. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data to uncover valuable insights that can inform stakeholders and facilitate more effective decision-making. By examining key factors such as loan application volumes, disbursement levels, and repayment receipts (including interest), the analysis provides a thorough assessment of the overall health of the loan portfolio.The analysis encompasses various dimensions such as loan purposes, terms, home ownership status, employment details, regional trends, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. Through examining these aspects, the project aims to reveal patterns, trends, and correlations within the data, thereby assisting lenders in making strategic decisions and managing risks effectively.
